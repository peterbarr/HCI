<h1 style="color:red;">26016291's First JavaScript Page!</h1>
<p style="color:green">Hello I am 26016291 from University of Reading studying computer science, this module is Human Computer Interaction. I am part of group 9 where we created a website to help students with ideas for meals that they should make to ensure they stay healthy while studying and keeping it affordable. I hope you enjoy reading my first website that uses JavaScript. There are two different JavaScript functions in my website, the
first is a simple calcualtion button that adds two numbers together and the other button changes the colour of text below it. I hope you enjoy reading my first website that uses JavaScript. :)</p>
